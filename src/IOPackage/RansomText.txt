One does not want a situation like Andhra Pradesh and Telangana during the creation of Bundelkhand state, 
BJP candidate from Jhansi Anurag Sharma said Saturday, noting that its formation remains an "uphill" task as the 
state's viability has to be ensured. The 55-year old managing director of Baidyanath, an Ayurvedic behemoth, 
has taken a plunge into politics after a successful career at the family-run business. However, it is not alien 
territory for Sharma. His father, Pandit Vishwanath Mishr, was a member of Parliament twice, once from Jhansi as a 
Congress candidate and once from Hamirpur on BJP ticket. Taking this political legacy forward, Sharma will face the 
electorate on April 29 when the Jhansi-Lalitpur seat goes to polls. He has already been heading the 'Bundelkhand 
Ekikaran Samiti' for the creation of separate Bundelkhand state. When asked about his views on the separate state 
as a candidate of the BJP, he said, "We will have to work towards it but it is an uphill task. I realise that 
because we have to take parts from two states and assemble them into one whole state." Underlining that smaller 
states are more effective, Sharma said he would sensitise the government as to how it can be turned into a 
"successful state".
